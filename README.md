# Vince Caruso's Professional Portfolio

## Purpose

This Portfolio will act as a showcase of some of my work so interested parties may asses my abilities. It also contains information about me and how to reach me. Links and 'about me' section will be updated as necessary. 

## Criterea Met:

WHEN you load their portfolio
THEN you are presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN you click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN you click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN you are presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN you click on the images of the applications
THEN you are taken to that deployed application

WHEN you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport
